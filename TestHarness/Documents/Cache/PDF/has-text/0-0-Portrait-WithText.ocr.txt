Dear Lieutenant Knight,
Thank you for your letter of February 8 regarding your office's application for an Off-Highway
Vehicle Grant and soliciting the public's support and comments. It's good to hear that efforts to
provide and enhance especially law enforcement and public safety and information and
education on environmental and conservation concerns are still being pursued.
At our local Centerville Beach, the four-wheelers continue to determine when and if we can
enjoy the beach peacefully and safely. Riders can be divided into the responsible operators, who
are not a safety or environmental problem, and the "hot shots" who are. There seem to be more
of the latter. These are the ones who frequently drive too fast, come too close, drive into
environmentally fragile areas, and wind up disturbing and sometimes endangering not only
people but resident plants and animals and damaging the dunes and cliffs. And then there's the
noise, the diesel exhaust, etc.,...all of which interfere with the safe use and enjoyment of an
otherwise beautiful natural area.
Our great preference would be to have the beach in its natural state, with no motor vehicles. If
this is not possible (and we realize this is not the point of your current efforts), the next best thing
would be to have in effect - and enforced - regulations that would allow access to responsible
drivers and impose sufficiently heavy penalties for irresponsible use to be an effective deterrent.
This would involve signage and, most importantly, stepped-up enforcement - well beyond what
is possible given current budget restraints. This is why the grant money is so important.
The above is the basis for our letter of April 2, 2009, when your office was in the application
process for a similar grant. Since then the situation has only worsened: more four-wheelers,
more environmental destruction, less opportunity for people to walk on the beach safely and
enjoyably. So it has become even more critical to have the beach patrolled and regulations
enforced. Even better, save this wonderful beach from the off-road vehicles.
Thank you so much for your efforts in pursuit of this grant and for your work in making and
keeping our beaches beautiful and safe. It is all very much appreciated.
Sincerely,
jesse tofacts. K
